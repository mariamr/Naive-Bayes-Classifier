This is an implementation of a  Naive Bayes Classifier in R language.The input file includes  sample data for experiments on weighting 4 bullets using a balance. The balance might lean to right("R") 
or left("L") depending on the weight of the bullets on each side. 

The goal is to predict the side that the balance would lean into based on the weight of the bullets on the right and left sides.

The program uses 90% of the sample records for training and the remaining 10% for test and outputs the average accuracy of the predictions after n runs.
